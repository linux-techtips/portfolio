Hi! My name is Carter. I'm a Software Engineer and avid Recreational Programmer.

I've had experience working at a fintech startup [Supply Pay](https://www.supplypay.io) and am currently finishing up my education at [UTRGV]("https://www.utrgv.edu/csci/research/index.htm) where I conduct student research.

As a programmer, I really love topics in language design and compiler engineering. I have a language: (neo) that I've been working on for quite some time that hopefully will be useful one day.

As a human I like my 3 cats, working out, and reading books like: [House Of Leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves)
