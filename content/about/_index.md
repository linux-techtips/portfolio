Hi! My name is Carter. I'm a Software Engineer and avid Recreational Programmer.

I've had experience working at a fintech startup {% link(url="https://www.supplypay.io/") %}Supply Pay{% end %} and am currently finishing up my education at {% link(url="https://www.utrgv.edu/csci/research/index.htm") %}UTRGV{% end %} where I conduct student research.

As a programmer, I really love topics in language design and compiler engineering. I have a language: (neo) that I've been woking on for quite some time that hopefully will be useful one day.

As a human I like my 3 cats, working out, and reading books like: {% link(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves") %}House Of Leaves {% end %}
